# OPLS-HDA 
Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Hierarchical Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-HDA)
OPLS-HDA integrates Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) with the OPLS-DA
framework to create a decision tree, addressing multiclass classification challenges and 
providing intuitive visualization of inter-class relationships. To avoid overfitting and
ensure reliable predictions, we use cross-validation during model building.


In ```simca_python_scripts```, the code to run OPLS-HDA in SIMCA 18.0 is available.

In ```ml_benchmakrs```, the code and most of the data to run benchmarks is available. The Breast Cancer data set can be downloaded at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brunogrisci/breast-cancer-gene-expression-cumida/data
