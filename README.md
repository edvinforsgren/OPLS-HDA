# OPLS-HDA 
Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Hierarchical Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-HDA)
OPLS-HDA integrates Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) with the OPLS-DA
framework to create a decision tree, addressing multiclass classification challenges and 
providing intuitive visualization of inter-class relationships. To avoid overfitting and
ensure reliable predictions, we use cross-validation during model building.

In ```simca_python_scripts```, the code to run OPLS-HDA in SIMCA 18.0 is available. A Free Trial can be downloaded at: [SIMA Free Trial](https://www.sartorius.com/en/products/process-analytical-technology/data-analytics-software/mvda-software/simca/simca-free-trial-download?_gl=1*1pa3nj2*_up*MQ..&gclid=CjwKCAjwgfm3BhBeEiwAFfxrG8DPK9j8sP1nNW9KEiEuxCxRCXLUknAG2ixq5Ey_4c3GVUYNiRki3BoCgNAQAvD_BwE)

In ```ml_benchmakrs```, the code and most of the data to run benchmarks is available. The Breast Cancer data set can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brunogrisci/breast-cancer-gene-expression-cumida/data).
